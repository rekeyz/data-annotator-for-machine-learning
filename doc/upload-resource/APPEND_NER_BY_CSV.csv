"This is a great Console and I recently started to work with it and everyday I find a new thing on it and getting to know it completely. It makes my job easier, WAY EASIER! Thanks.","[{""started to work with it and"":[39,66]},{""completely"":[124,134]}]",,
"Only feedback is back the GUI nicer/not as big and blocky, e.g. on my macbook pro 13,3 everything is squished together,",,,

The language in German would be very helpful,,,
There are so many features that it's hard to find some of them.,,,
"The Workspace ONE UEM Console is very intuitive and overall seems to be quite easy to use.  I occasionally find the security around logging in to ba a little frustrating, but I also understand the need for this. I have no major complaints.",,,

"very slow in loading pages, issues with Huawei phones alloing the QR code enrollment, Logs need to have web activity per user, need to keep the logs after phones are deleted to show who deleted the devices, when a device wipe has been put on the system system should not allow the device / user to be deleted as the device wipe fails to send the wipe command after the removal of the unit","[{""slow"":[5,9]}]","[{""Huawei phones"":[40,53]}]",
Very buggy here lately. Is it AirWatch or Workspace ONE UEM. Is it an MDM or UEM. Agent is now Hub. Too much changing going on.,,"[{""Workspace ONE UEM ."":[42,60]},{""MDM"":[70,73]},{""UEM"":[77,80]},{""Hub"":[95,98]}]",
"When using the Search option under Devices, and searching by ""Last, first name"", there are no results. We have to switch to Accounts, or search ""First.lastname"" as if it were an @va.gov email. In this past this was a feature which made searching for users easier. Can this be re-implemented?",,,
The console is very good and working fine,,,
"Interface is very clunky, not easy to use, and unless you use the console on a daily basis, you can expect to forget where items are. It's really the least user friendly user interface that I have ever used.",,,

Dashboard access could be improved. There's limitations going between devices.,,,

"The lag when trying to update app assignments, profiles, etc., especially for large groups, is killer.  When I apply settings to one app, device, profile, etc, I want to return to the same page I was on before, but it always bumps me back to page 1.  The pop-up confirmations (e.g. ""device sync initiated"" when I ask it to sync a device) really kill the workflow.  I'd like the ability to totally turn off management for device types I don't use AirWatch for.","[{""lag"":[4,7]}]","[{""AirWatch"":[446,454]}]",
I would like you guys to focus on 1 thing that would help our orginization a ton.  1. Make HTML email signatures possible in Boxer. It would make it feel very professional to use Boxer then.,"[{""guys"":[17,21]}]","[{""Boxer"":[125,130]}]",
